## Understanding LIST vs. data list vs. SET

ComfyUI has different data types that serve different purposes:

### 1. data list
- A native ComfyUI list where **items are processed individually**
- Acts like a standard array/list in most programming contexts
- Items can be accessed individually by compatible nodes
- Supports built-in ComfyUI iteration over each item
- Best for:
    - Working directly with multiple items in parallel
    - Batch processing scenarios
    - When you need to apply the same operation to multiple inputs
    - When your operation needs to work with individual items separately

### 2. LIST datatype
- A Python list represented as a **single variable** in the workflow
- Treated as a self-contained object that can be passed between nodes
- Cannot directly connect to nodes that expect individual items
- Best for:
  - Working with collections of data as a single unit
  - Storing intermediate results that need to be processed as a whole
  - Passing collections between different parts of your workflow
  - Complex data storage that shouldn't be split apart

### 3. SET datatype
- A Python set represented as a **single variable** in the workflow
- Stores unique values with no duplicates
- Supports mathematical set operations (union, intersection, etc.)
- Best for:
  - Eliminating duplicate values
  - Testing membership efficiently
  - Set operations (union, difference, etc.)
  - When element order doesn't matter

### When to use which type
- Use **LIST** when you need:
  - Ordered collection with potential duplicates
  - To preserve insertion order
  - To access elements by position/index
  - To use methods like append, extend, etc.

- Use **SET** when you need:
  - Collection of unique values (no duplicates)
  - Fast membership testing (x in set)
  - Set theory operations (union, intersection)
  - To eliminate duplicates from data

- Use **data list** when you need to:
  - Process each item individually through ComfyUI nodes
  - Allow nodes to iterate through your items automatically
  - Connect to nodes that expect individual inputs
  - Perform batch processing operations
