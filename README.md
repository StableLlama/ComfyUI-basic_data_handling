# Basic data handling

Basic Python functions for manipulating data that every programmer is used to.

These nodes are very lightweight and require no additional dependencies.

## Quickstart

1. Install [ComfyUI](https://docs.comfy.org/get_started).
1. Install [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager)
1. Look up this extension in ComfyUI-Manager. If you are installing manually, clone this repository under `ComfyUI/custom_nodes`.
1. Restart ComfyUI.

  - Logic operations: and, or, not, xor, nand, nor

## Tests

This repo contains unit tests written in Pytest in the `tests/` directory. It is recommended to unit test your custom node.

- [build-pipeline.yml](.github/workflows/build-pipeline.yml) will run pytest and linter on any open PRs
- [validate.yml](.github/workflows/validate.yml) will run [node-diff](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/node-diff) to check for breaking changes
